# 🧩 Attribute Parser (C++)

This is my solution to the HackerRank problem:  
🔗 [Attribute Parser – HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/attribute-parser/problem?isFullScreen=true)

A C++ implementation of an attribute parser for a nested, XML-like tag structure. This parser:
- Handles **nested tags**
- Extracts **attribute name/value** pairs
- Answers **queries** by maintaining the tag hierarchy manually

---

## 📌 Features
- **Class-based structure** – no maps, no STL crutches
- Clean **object-oriented design**
- Manual simulation of key-value mapping and nesting logic

---

## 🧠 Why Highlight This?
Instead of using built-in maps or libraries, I challenged myself to replicate similar behavior using just **vectors, string manipulation**, and **manual data structuring**. It’s a foundational exercise that helped me deeply understand:
- How to simulate associative structures
- The importance of data layout and hierarchy
- Parsing logic at a low level

Not the most scalable solution — but 100% hand-built and mentally rewarding.
